### Using Auto-Measurements Plugin

#### Automatic Circle Detection with Matrix Naming
1. Open one or more radiochromic film images
2. Navigate to the "AutoMeasurements" tab
3. Click "Add Files" to load multiple images for batch processing
4. Adjust detection parameters if needed:
   - Film detection: Canny thresholds, morphology kernel
   - Circle detection: Hough parameters, diameter restrictions
5. Click "Start Detection"
6. Circles will be automatically detected and named based on their spatial position:
   - **C11** = First row, first column (top-left)
   - **C12** = First row, second column
   - **C21** = Second row, first column
   - **C34** = Third row, fourth column
   - etc.

#### Understanding Circle Names
- **First digit**: Row number (1 = top, 2 = second from top, etc.)
- **Second digit**: Column number (1 = leftmost, 2 = second from left, etc.)
- **"M" suffix**: Manually added circles (e.g., C1M, C2M) to distinguish from auto-detected

#### CSV Export Features
1. After detection, click "Export CSV"
2. Choose save location
3. The CSV will include:
   - **Filename**: Extracted automatically from image path
   - **Date**: From metadata or manual input
   - **Film & Circle**: With matrix naming (RC_1, C11, etc.)
   - **95% CI**: Automatically calculated (SE × 1.96)
   - **Clean numbers**: No ± symbols for easy spreadsheet processing

#### Multi-File Workflow
1. Click "Add Files" and select multiple TIFF images
2. Use navigation buttons (< >) to switch between files
3. File counter shows current position (e.g., "2/5")
4. Each file maintains its own:
   - Detected circles and measurements
   - CTR (control) circle assignments
   - Detection parameters
5. Export CSV to combine all files into one spreadsheet

#### CTR (Control) Background Subtraction
1. Select a circle designated as background/control
2. Click "Toggle CTR" or ctrl+click to mark it as control circle

### Calibration

1. Click on "Tools" → "Calibration Wizard"
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate your measurements

### Configuring Uncertainty Estimation

1. Go to "File" → "Settings"
2. Scroll to "Uncertainty Estimation" section
3. Select your preferred method:
   - **weighted_average**: Standard approach, recommended for most cases
   - **birge_factor**: Accounts for excess channel-to-channel scatter
   - **dersimonian_laird**: Most conservative, includes systematic uncertainties
4. Click "Apply" to save changes
5. Existing measurements will be recalculated with the new method

**When to use each method**:
- Use **Weighted Average** for routine measurements with consistent channels
- Use **Birge Factor** if RGB channels show more variation than expected
- Use **DerSimonian-Laird** for maximum conservatism or when channels may have systematic differences

### Error Logs

- Error logs are stored in `rc_analyzer.log` in the application directory
- Check this file for detailed error information if you encounter issues

## Recent Updates

### Version 2.0 - October 2025

#### Matrix-Based Circle Naming System
- **Spatial Organization**: Circles are automatically organized into a grid matrix based on their physical position
- **Intuitive Naming**: Circles named as C{row}{column} (e.g., C11, C12, C21, C34)
  - First digit = row number (top to bottom)
  - Second digit = column number (left to right)
- **Smart Row Detection**: Y-coordinate clustering algorithm groups circles into rows with configurable tolerance (avg_radius × 0.5)
- **Auto-sorting**: Within each row, circles are sorted left-to-right by X-coordinate
- **Manual Circle Distinction**: Manually added circles use C{n}M naming (e.g., C1M, C2M) to distinguish from auto-detected circles

#### Advanced Uncertainty Estimation Methods
The application now supports three sophisticated methods for combining uncertainties from RGB channels:

1. **Weighted Average** (Default recommended for most cases)
   - Combines channel measurements weighted by inverse variance
   - Formula: `w_i = 1/σ²_i`, `μ = Σ(w_i × x_i) / Σ(w_i)`
   - Combined uncertainty: `σ_combined = 1/√(Σw_i)`
   - Best for: Standard measurements with normally distributed uncertainties

2. **Birge Factor** (For handling inconsistent channel measurements)
   - Applies scaling factor when channel-to-channel scatter exceeds expected uncertainty
   - Birge ratio: `R_B = χ²_reduced / √(2/(N-1))`
   - If R_B > 1: scales uncertainties by R_B to account for excess scatter
   - Best for: Measurements where channels show more variation than expected
   - Prevents underestimation of uncertainty when channels disagree
   - **Reference**: Birge, R.T. (1932). "The Calculation of Errors by the Method of Least Squares". Physical Review, 40(2), 207-227. doi:10.1103/PhysRev.40.207

3. **DerSimonian-Laird** (Meta-analysis approach)
   - Adds between-channel variance (τ²) to within-channel variance
   - Iteratively estimates heterogeneity between channels
   - Formula: `τ² = max(0, (Q - (N-1)) / C)` where Q is Cochran's Q statistic
   - Best for: When channels may have systematic differences
   - Most conservative approach, accounts for both random and systematic uncertainties
   - **Reference**: DerSimonian, R. & Laird, N. (1986). "Meta-analysis in clinical trials". Controlled Clinical Trials, 7(3), 177-188. doi:10.1016/0197-2456(86)90046-2

**Method Selection**: Configure in `Settings → Uncertainty Estimation → Method for combining channel uncertainties`

**Technical Details**:
- All methods properly propagate uncertainties through calibration curves
- Uncertainty calculations are performed using the selected method for each measurement

#### CSV Column Structure
The exported CSV now contains 11 columns in this order:
1. **Filename** - Image filename (without path)
2. **Date** - Measurement date (from metadata or manual input)
3. **Film** - Film identifier (RC_1, RC_2, etc.)
4. **Circle** - Circle identifier with matrix naming (C11, C12, etc.)
5. **doses_per_channel** - Dose values per RGB channel
6. **STD_doses_per_channel** - Standard deviation per channel 
7. **average** - Average dose value
8. **SE_average** - Standard error of average (4 decimals)
9. **95%confident_interval(SE)** - 95% CI = SE × 1.96 (4 decimals)
10. **pixel_count** - Number of pixels in measurement
11. **uncertainty_calculation_method** - Method used (e.g., dersimonian_laird)


#### Algorithm Details
The matrix organization algorithm works as follows:
1. Sort all detected circles by Y-coordinate
2. Group circles into rows using Y-clustering (tolerance = avg_radius × 0.5)
3. Sort rows from top to bottom
4. Within each row, sort circles left to right by X-coordinate
5. Assign names: C{row_idx}{col_idx}

Example result for 3×4 grid:
```
Row 1: C11, C12, C13, C14
Row 2: C21, C22, C23, C24
Row 3: C31, C32, C33, C34
```
